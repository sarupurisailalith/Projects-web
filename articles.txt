We need to sort this by year in ascending order may be…

2011	“Traning in the martial arts at the age of eight and 10 helped me brave the pain. The rigours that I put in training for karate, taekwondo and judo (he holds a black belt in the last) has enhanced my capacity. Only a cyclist will know the mental and physical stress that accompanies cyclists who travel more than 300 kilometres at a stretch,” he says.	http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/tough-cycle-to-complete/article1606694.ece

2013	Samim Rizvi’s cycling interest spans over 30 years and he has himself matured from recreational cycling to professional focus in the past 10 years. Today he lays great emphasis on endurance cycling.  He continues to pursue his dream of racing around the world, proudly representing India, and to train his teammates to excel in the sport, creating an internationally qualified team from India.

2008	Samim got hooked onto cycling when he was in France in 1998. Watching the large number of cyclists in the Tour de France, Samim nursed the hope that he too would one day be a participant.	http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/pedal-power/article1418932.ece

2013	Bangalorean Samim Rizvi is the first ever Indian to participate and complete the RAAM – the Race Across America, the ‘world’s toughest bicycle race’ across 3,000 miles in under 12 days. Gautam Raja, who was on the race crew, writes about the near non-stop bicycle ride across the country.	http://www.thealternative.in/lifestyle/spocial-revolution-samim-rizvi-racing-across-america-on-a-bicycle/

2011	A bicycle, perched atop a parked car in K.S. Rao Road on Sunday morning, drew several curious looks.

Its owner Samim Rizvi, a Bangalore-based professional cyclist, had reached Mangalore cycling from Bangalore.	http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/a-cyclist-with-a-green-cause/article2335015.ece

2010	I met Sam in 2008 at my first attempt at MTB Himachal here in India, his first time on a mountain bike. (He was in my posting then, and in the CNN-IBN video clip.) Some weeks later I visited him and several other new friends in Bangalore, and over the last year and a half we have become close friends. He's actually a road racer, and has had his share of drama and thwarted plans since then in getting to this point - a 24-hour time trial to qualify for the Race Across America (RAAM).	http://whereisshethistime.blogspot.in/2010/03/24-hours-701-kilometers.html

2012	Samim Rizvi , a 42-year-old cycling demon from Bangalore, became the first Indian in 27 years to participate in the Race Across America (Raam), the world’s toughest bicycle race—one that began in Oceanside in California and ended at Annapolis on the East Coast after traversing 4,800km across the US, clocking a total elevation of 100,000ft, in less than 10 days.	http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/Zpf6cjWtuCrQ8wNI2KrtLO/Pedalling-nirvana.html
